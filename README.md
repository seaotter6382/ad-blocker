# ad-blocker
some ad blocker (it hopefully blocks ads)

# how it works

so basically there is a list or table, and it goes through the intire list and deletes all of the html elements in that list
read the script.js file for more info

if you want to, you could change the ads tabel to be something else, example:

`
const ads = [
    'any html element',
    'div.cool',
    'p.test',
]
`
